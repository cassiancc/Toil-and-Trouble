This mod empower Cauldrons with additional functionality, including the ability to brew Potions.

## Installation

Toil and Trouble is a client and server mod for Fabric and NeoForge 1.21.1. Its dependencies are listed below.

#### Dependencies
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is required on Fabric Loader.
- [McQoy](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcqoy) is recommended to configure the mod.


## Features

- Cauldrons can now be used for brewing! Fill a cauldron up with water and insert a Nether Wart to brew it into an Awkward Potion, and then add a reagent like Blaze Powder to brew a Potion (Fire Resistance, in the case of Blaze Powder).
- Unlike Brewing Stands, Cauldrons do not require fuel. This is intentional, but a config option can be changed to make them require heating, or to allow heating to speed up the brewing process.
- Potions can be retrieved with Bottles, and Arrows can be dipped into Potion Cauldrons in order to turn them into Tipped Arrows. You can even throw items directly into the Cauldron to automate the brewing process.

## Mod Compatibility
- Modded brewing recipes will work out of the box, as this mod allows cauldrons to craft anything a Brewing Stand can.
- [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade) shows the contents of Potion Cauldrons.
- If you are using this mod alongside [Amendments](https://modrinth.com/mod/amendments), it's recommended to disable its Improved Cauldron functionality, as its changes to the cauldron intersect with this mod's.

## FAQ
- Will this mod be ported to other versions/loaders?
    - Currently the mod actively supports 1.21.1, with a planned port to latest (currently 1.21.8). There is no plan to backport to older versions or any other loaders, as the mod relies extensively on 1.21+ features.
