# Depending on Toil and Trouble

While Toil and Trouble's recipes are entirely data-driven, mod developers may want to add it to their developer environment in order to easily test against the mod. For that reason, it is available on my maven.

## gradle.properties
```gradle
toil_and_trouble_version = 1.2.0
```

## Adding the maven
```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "cassian's maven"
        url = "https://maven.cassian.cc"
    }
}
```

## Fabric
```gradle
modImplementation "cc.cassian.toil_and_trouble:toil_and_trouble-fabric:${toil_and_trouble_version}+${minecraft_version}"
```

## NeoForge
```gradle
implementation "cc.cassian.toil_and_trouble:toil_and_trouble-neoforge:${toil_and_trouble_version}+${minecraft_version}"
```

## Architectury Common
```gradle
modImplementation "cc.cassian.toil_and_trouble:toil_and_trouble-common:${toil_and_trouble_version}+${minecraft_version}"
```
